<h4>Tropical Stochastic Skeleton Model (TSSM)</h4>

code by Sulian Thual 

Matlab code to integrate a TSSM model for climate variability in the tropics (El Nino Southern Oscillation and Madden-Julian Oscillation) and perform several analysis.

references: https://github.com/sulianthual/tssm

<h4>Introduction: </h4>


The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) are major climate phenomena in the tropics. The TSSM simulates both phenomena and provides important theoretical understanding on their interactions. The model is described in details in a scientific article: 

Thual, S., Majda, A.J. and Chen, N., 2018: A Tropical Stochastic Skeleton Model for the MJO, El Ni√±o and Dynamic Walker Circulation: A Simplified GCM. J. Climate, doi: 10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0263.1


<h4>Instructions: </h4>

1) You need matlab installed.

2) Follow the file Instructions.pdf on how to run and analyze the model.
